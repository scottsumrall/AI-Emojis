# AI-Emojis
This program is a form of Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DCGAN) that generates unique images of emojis. The 'discriminator' portion of the network is trained on several hundred images of emjois to identify whether images generated by the 'generator' are emojis or not. The 'generator' is trained based on its success in fooling the 'discriminator' with the original emojis it generates.

## Getting Started

This program was created using Google Colab. As written the program must be linked to google drive for file storage and access. Additionally, the collection of emojis used for training is not included in this respository due to size constraints.
